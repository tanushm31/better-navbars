# Better Navbars

This Project aims to create Headless UI for Navbar components.
The Project is in very early stage right now.

## Project Goals and stages:

- **STAGE 0**: Build the basic Navbar MVP and define a structure that can be reused and extended
- **STAGE 1**: Add customizability to the Navbar, so the users can change the Navbar to their needs

More to follow...

## Maybe this diagram will help explain **STAGE 0**:
